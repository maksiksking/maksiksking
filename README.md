A bit of everything really - web dev, design, generally programming, video editing, music, audio editing, whatever-ish else.

Mostly do web-design tho. I feel like most of my repos either some silly college homework that I had to host or me abusing the system in some silly way like making my bookmarks aesthetic by hosting a hollow website on pages. But there are some more interesting things here as well.
